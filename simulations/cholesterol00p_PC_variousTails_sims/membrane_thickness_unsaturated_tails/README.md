Here I test the permeability of the small "S" particle
through membranes of varying thicknesses 
using  Martini 3. 

The simulations in this folder were adopted from previous efforts 
and hence the repository does not include scripts and methods for their creation from the beginning. 

A simple plot is included in the 
[Jupyter notebook in this folder.](calculate-permeability-friction-from-sim-jacopo.ipynb)
