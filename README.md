# Permeability of small polar solutes through lipid membranes at various phases

This is a project that started independently 
as my work with permeability of ethanol trhough lipid membranes and 
the work in Poolman's lab done by Jacopo Frallicciardi. 

They have developed an accurate technique to measure permeability of small polar compounds 
and now they are interested in understanding how such compounds, especially weak acids and water,
permeate through lipid membranes in the context of yeast lipids and yeast plasma membrane. 

My simulations are instrumental in understanding what are the driving forces in the process and
what happens on the molecular level.
