# *In silico* investigation of the permeability of small polar solutes through lipid membranes at various phases

Repository supporting the *in silico* part of the research.

## What does this repository contain?

### Simulations settings, initial configurations and extra topologies
This repository contains the **files required to run the simulations** for this project. 
This includes several initial starting configurations of the membrane systems,
simulation setup "mdp" files
as well as 
extra topology files for any specialized molecules used in the project 
(e.g. an array of permeating solutes of varying hydrophobicity 
located in the [the top folder](top/martini_v3.0_solvents.itp))

### Analysis scripts of the simulation trajectories
I have also included the **analysis scripts of the simulation trajectories**
In order to reproduce the simulations,
it is necessarry to have a working installation of the GROMACS software (v2019.1 or higher)
and a sufficient computational resources to calculate the trajectories. 
The analysis scripts use the built-in GROMACS tools to analyze the simulation trajectories,
and they are written in BASH.
In order to successfuly run the simulations and analysis, 
some adaptations specific to the running conditions are needed 
(e.g. changing workging directories or paths to GROMACS software). 

### Notebooks calculating membrane properties, permeability coefficients and creating plots
The **ipython notebooks calculate the membrane properties** 
including the permeability coefficients
from the files generated by the analysis scripts above. 
These notebooks can be also used stand-alone to 
access the pre-calculated values from a "CSV" dataset
and plot the results.
