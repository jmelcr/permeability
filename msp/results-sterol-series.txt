# Sterols modulate permeability by affecting membrane properties and phase state. 

Many biological membranes contain a varying amount of sterols,
which increases the complexity of their properties and phase behaviour. 
To assess such effects on the permeability of weak acids through 
we have studied membranes with different sterol concentration from 15 to 45%. 
We have selected cholesterol and ergosterol, 
which are the main sterols of mammalian cells and yeast, respectively, 
and are predominantly found in the plasma membrane (Gunstone, 1996a, Gunstone, 1996b). 
Permeability coefficients 
of membranes with varying concentrations of sterols and unsaturation index
from experiments and simulations 
are shown in Figure 4, and all values are in Table 4. 


# Sterols decrease permeability coefficient in fluid membranes.

For the membranes with POPC (d=0.5), 
both sterols, ergosterol and cholesterol, 
lead to a small but significant decrease in permeability;
in line with the known smaller condensing effect of erogsterol compared to cholesterol
on lipid bilayer structure 
(Hung et al. 2016 Biophys J, Urbina et al. BBA1995), 
the decrease of permeability coefficient is only about 4-fold for ergosterol, 
but 9-fold for cholesterol. 
Similar effects are observed 
when titrating both sterols in vesicles composed of DOPC (table SI.5 AND figure S4). 
Our simulations show
that in analogy to the effects of a decreasing unsaturation index from membranes without sterols (Fig 5), 
the permeability coefficient decreases
with increasing sterol concentration in fluid POPC membranes 
because of higher and wider free energy barriers (Fig 4D).
The effects of additional cholesterol concentrations to a POPC membrane from simulations 
are smaller in magnitude than in the experiment, 
but in line with the general trend. 


The phase change from Ld to LO
occuring in the simulations between POPC with 15% and 30% sterol concentration
leads to a notable emerging shoulder in the profile around 1.0 nm distance from the membrane centre
where it is accompanied by a small depression in the profile (0.0 nm) in Fig 4D. 
The corresponding changes of the permeability coefficients and free energy profiles
are in accordance with our experiments (Fig 4 and Fig S4) 
as well as with the recent simulation works
comparing the permeability of water through membranes at LO and Ld phases (Ghysels et al. 2019). 

These characteristic features of the Free energy profiles from the LO phase 
are linked to the sterol-induced changes in 
lipid packing (Cournia 2007JPCB) 
and in the lateral pressure profile (Ollila 2007 Journal of Structural Biology). 
Unless a phase transition occurs, 
the shoulder in the profile continues to smoothly build up 
with decreasing unsaturation index towards DPPC (i.e., towards d=0.0)
as shown in Fig SxyMDchol_unsatur in SI.




# Permeability through saturated DPPC membranes with sterols is governed by its phase behaviour 

Titration of sterols into fully saturated DPPC bilayers has the opposite effect on solute permeability
compared to the fluid POPC membranes. 
In both experiments and simulations,
we observe an overall increase of the permeability coefficient 
of about one order of magnitude between DPPC membranes with 0 and 45% of cholesterol or ergosterol. 
Such a large difference is caused by the change of the membrane phase 
from Lβ to LO upon addition of sterols to DPPC membranes. 


Also conversely to the effects on the fluid POPC membrane, 
additional sterol concentrations in fully saturated DPPC membranes
perturb the highly ordered acyl chains of the DPPC lipids
leading to a significant decrease of the friction coefficient 
from a DPPC bilayer to DPPC with 15% cholesterol concentration (Fig 4E). 
As the Free energy profiles 
for the DPPC membrane with 0% and 15% concentration of cholesterol 
are comparable in height and width,
the change in the friction through the membranes at Lβ phase 
is a large factor affecting the difference in the permeability coefficient
between the two membrane compositions. 

Moreover,
the added 15% cholesterol concentration 
prevents water molecules to follow the permeating solute 
into the membrane hydrophobic core (Fig 4F). 
While water molecules can follow the permeating solutes 
into the DPPC membrane even below 1.0 nm (Fig 4F),
adding 15% cholesterol concentration to the membrane
keeps the water molecules from entering below that threshold. 
This is linked to the shift of the free energy barrier 
from 0.5 nm in DPPC to 1.3 nm in DPPC with 15% cholesterol 
as the additional sterols enforce solute dewetting 
further from the hydrophobic region of the membrane. 
This effect is caused by the highly anizotropic structure of the DPPC bilayer at a Lβ phase,
which forms "wedge-like" defects to accommodate the permeating solutes 
through its highly ordered structure 
exposing an accessible surface for the solvent molecules to enter "for free". 


Adding more sterols to the fully saturated DPPC membrane above 15% cholesterol 
in the simulations
leads to a change in the membrane phase from Lβ to LO phase
and another order of magnitude increase in the permeability coefficient, 
which is a direct consequence of the dramatically lowered free energy barrier (Fig 4D). 
In contrast,
adding more sterols to the membrane at the LO phase from 30% to 45% cholesterol 
leads to a decrease of the permeability coefficient
similarly as in the case of the membranes with POPC.
As both compositions are at the same LO phase, 
this effect can be attributed to the condensing effect of cholesterol
on lipid bilayer structure (Hung et al. 2016 Biophys J, Urbina et al. BBA1995). 

In summary, 
the permeability coefficients decrease with the membrane fluidity 
in the order Ld > LO > Lβ,  
each transition leading to an order of magnitude change in the permeability coefficient. 


# The phase behaviour of ergosterol and cholesterol in DPPC membranes is different leading to distinct effects on the permeability

The phase transitions occurs differently for ergosterol and cholesterol.
While adding a relatively small amount of sterols (15 mol%) to a DPPC bilayer in the Lβ phase 
increases the membrane permeability coefficient for formic acid,
approximately 13-fold for cholesterol in experiments,
it does so only 4-fold for ergosterol (Fig 4B). 
Also as opposed to cholesterol,
increasing the concentration of ergosterol in DPPC membranes up to 45% 
leads to a gradual increase of the permeability coefficient for formic acid,
suggesting a smooth change of membrane phase from Lβ to LO through coexistence. 

The membrane phase state of DPPC with 15% and 30% cholesterol or ergosterol 
is in a mixed coexistence of Lβ and LO phases (Table S5 in SI) 
as confirmed by our DSC measurements (Fig S3 in SI).
The DPPC membrane with 15% cholesterol in MD simulations forms a stable Lβ phase,
but the DPPC membrane with 30% cholesterol forms a stable LO phase 
yielding a large change in the free energy profile 
and a corresponding increase in the permeability coefficient. 
Comparison of the changes of the permeability coefficients between simulations and experiments
suggests that ergosterol has a higher tendency to form a Lβ phase,
while cholesterol already forms prefereably a LO phase at the same composition. 
This is well in line with the observed overall
smaller effects of ergosterol on lipid bilayer structure compared to that of cholesterol 
(Hung et al. 2016 Biophys J, Urbina et al. BBA1995). 

This also explains the intrigueing behaviour of L-lactic acid,
which has more than one order of magnitude lower permeability coefficient compared to formic acid
making it hard to permeate through the membranes with DPPC and measure in the experiments (Table S5 in SI). 
We have measured a detectable signal from L-lactic acid 
only for DPPC vesicles with 30% and 45% of ergosterol 
yielding comparably large relative changes of the permeability coefficients 
to those from the formic acid (Fig 4B). 
Interestingly enough,
no permeation of L-lactic acid on the timescale of 10 hours 
was detected through DPPC vesicles with cholesterol (Fig 4A). 
This observation is in line with the known higher condensing effect of cholesterol compared to ergosterol
and that cholesterol forms aggregates at higher concentrations,
which prevent the permeation 
(Hung et al. 2016 Biophys J, Urbina et al. BBA1995, Barrett et al. 2013, Elkins JPCB2021).
