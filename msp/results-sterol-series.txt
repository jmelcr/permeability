# Sterols modulate permeability by affecting membrane properties and phase state. 

Many biological membranes contain varying amount of sterols
increasing the complexity of their properties and phase behaviour. 
To assess such effects on the permeability of weak acids through 
we have studied membranes with different sterol concentration from 15 to 45%. 
We have selected cholesterol and ergosterol, 
which are the main sterols of mammalian cells and yeast, respectively, 
and are predominantly found in the plasma membrane (Gunstone, 1996a, Gunstone, 1996b). 
Permeability coefficients from experiments and simulations 
from membranes with varying concentrations of sterols and unsaturation index
are shown in Figure 4, and all values are in Table 4. 


# Sterol titration to fluid membranes - POPC

For the membranes with POPC (d=0.5), 
both sterols, ergosterol and cholesterol, 
lead to a small but significant decrease in permeability;
about 4 fold for ergosterol and 9 fold for cholesterol. 
Similar effects are observed 
when titrating both sterols in vesicles composed of DOPC (table SI.5 AND figure S4). 
The effects of additional cholesterol concentrations to a POPC membrane from simulations 
are smaller in magnitude than in the experiment, 
but in line with the general trend. 

Increasing the sterol concentration in fluid POPC membranes 
increases the height and width of the free energy barrier (Fig 4D),
similarly to the effects of a decreasing unsaturation index from membranes without sterols (Fig 5). 
This leads to a corresponding decrease of the calculated permeability coefficient (Fig 4 C). 
The permeability coefficients from the simulations 
of POPC bilayers with cholesterol qualitatively agree with the experimental results, 
but underestimate the rigidity of the bilayer at high sterol concentrations, 
resulting in an overall higher permeability coefficients. 


Moreover,
the phase change from Ld to LO
occuring in the simulations between POPC with 15% and 30% sterol concentration
leads to a notable emerging shoulder in the profile around 1.0 nm distance from the membrane centre
where it is accompanied by a small depression in the profile (0.0 nm) in Fig 4 D. 
This is in accordance with our experiments (Fig 4 and Fig S4) 
as well as with the free energy profiles from the recent simulation work 
comparing the permeability of water through membranes at LO and Ld phases (Ghysels et al. 2019). 

These characteristic features of the Free energy profiles from the LO phase, 
and are linked to the sterol-induced changes in 
lipid packing (Cournia 2007JPCB) 
and in the lateral pressure profile (Ollila 2007 Journal of Structural Biology). 
Unless a phase transition occurs, 
the shoulder in the profile continues to smoothly build up 
with decreasing unsaturation index towards DPPC (i.e., towards d=0.0)
as shown in Fig SxyMDchol_unsatur in SI.


# Sterol titration to gel membranes - DPPC / gel part

Titration of sterols into fully saturated DPPC bilayers has the opposite effect on solute permeability
compared to the fluid POPC membranes. 
In both experiments and simulations,
we observe an overall increase of the permeability coefficient 
of about one order of magnitude between DPPC membranes with 0 and 45% of cholesterol or ergosterol. 
Such a large difference is caused by the change of the membrane phase 
from Lβ to LO upon addition of sterols to DPPC membranes. 

Adding a relatively small amount of sterols (15 mol%) to a DPPC bilayer in the Lβ phase 
increases the membrane permeability coefficient 
depending on the sterol type. 
The membrane phase state of DPPC with 15% cholesterol or ergosterol 
is in a mixed coexistence of Lβ and LO phases (Table S5 in SI) 
as confirmed by our DSC measurements (Fig S3 in SI),
while the MD simulations form a stable Lβ phase at the same conditions. 

In contrast to the effects on the fluid POPC membrane, 
additional sterol concentrations in fully saturated DPPC membranes
perturb the highly ordered acyl chains of the DPPC lipids
leading to a significant decrease of the friction coefficient (Fig 4E). 
As the Free energy profiles 
for the DPPC membrane with 0% and 15% concentration of cholesterol 
are comparable in height and width,
the change in the diffusivity through the membranes at Lβ phase 
is the main factor affecting the difference in the permeability coefficient
between the two membrane compositions. 

Moreover,
the added 15% cholesterol concentration 
prevents water molecules to follow the permeating solute 
into the membrane hydrophobic core (Fig 4F). 
While water molecules can follow the permeating solutes 
into the DPPC membrane even below 1.0 nm (Fig 4F),
adding 15% cholesterol concentration to the membrane
keeps the water molecules from entering below that threshold. 
This is linked to the shift of the free energy barrier 
from 0.5 nm in DPPC to 1.3 nm in DPPC with 15% cholesterol 
as the additional sterols enforce solute dewetting 
further from the hydrophobic region of the membrane. 



# Sterol titration to gel membranes - DPPC / LO part



Adding more sterols to the fully DPPC membrane from 15% to 30% cholesterol 
leads to a change in the membrane phase from Lβ to LO phase
in the simulations
and another order of magnitude increase in the permeability coefficient, 
which is a direct consequence of the dramatically lowered free energy barrier (Fig 4D). 
The experiments show a larger increase of the permeabilit coefficient for cholesterol,
which is due to the coexistence of Lβ to LO phases in the vesicles. 
In contrast,
adding more sterols to the membrane at the LO phase from 30% to 45% cholesterol 
leads to a decrease of the permeability coefficient
similarly as in the case of the membranes with POPC.


# Difference between membranes with ergosterol and cholesterol.

This feature is different between cholesterol and ergosterol,
for which the permeability coefficient in DPPC membranes is increasing 
through all studied concentrations up to 45% ergosterol. 
This is likely the result of the different phase behaviour of cholesterol and ergosterol,
which interacts more favourably with the saturated lipid tails of DPPC. 


The permeability of L-lactic acid in DPPC vesicles with 30 to 45% of ergosterol is comparable to that of formic acid and at least x-orders of magnitude higher than of DPPC vesicles with cholesterol (Fig 4); in fact, we didn’t measure any L-lactic acid permeation on the timescale of 10 hours. 
This observation is in line with the view that ergosterol has a stronger capacity to promote the Lo phase and has a lower condensing effect than cholesterol at same concentrations (Cournia et al. 
2007; Hung et al. 
2016). 
Moreover, adding ergosterol to DPPC membranes has a more monotonous trend compared to that of cholesterol (Fig 4), which may be related to the stronger capacity of ergosterol to promote tail ordering in saturated lipid membranes than cholesterol, while the opposite is true for unsaturated membranes (Hung et al. 
2016; Urbina et al. 1995). 
This difference may be also connected to the capacity of cholesterol to form immiscible plaques and aggregates at high concentrations (Barrett et al. 2013) (Elkins 2021).



In summary, 
the permeability coefficients decrease with the membrane fluidity 
in the order Ld > LO > Lβ,  
each transition leading to an order of magnitude change in the permeability coefficient.
